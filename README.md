# Multiple-Linear-Regression - Least Squares Method
# Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using the Least Squares Method. Multiple Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and multiple independent variables (features) using a linear equation. The goal is to find the best-fitting hyperplane to predict the target variable.

The implementation applies the Least Squares method to compute the coefficients of the regression model that minimize the sum of the squared residuals.

# Features
Multiple Linear Regression: Implements the model for predicting a target variable based on multiple independent variables.
Least Squares Method: Uses the least squares technique to calculate the optimal coefficients for the model.
Model Evaluation: Includes evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess model performance.
Data Preprocessing: Handles data splitting into training and testing sets.
